# SL19
Day 1 #
It's official! SL has now the logbook obviesly on GH! By the way, reasons of the born of SL it's ... Mick And Steve, that will be glad one day that all this will
be present, why not, to the whole world!

Here, it's Troca speaking! Nice to meet you! SL will be a marvelous idea for whose will be in the New World! It's a simple Android application that allow two
employers and their relative job givers the exchange theri job. Why this ? Let's be honest. We spent about 30-40 years get to work, every single day, except for the
(holies precisely) holiday, Christmas, New Year's, Easter, Summertime ... and after ? YOU KNOW, the same thing!

Working for at least 8 hours per day (someplaces even 12), from Monday to Friday (someplaces to Saturday/Sunday) ... at least, can we make work less tedious and
painful ? Can we make work ... enjoyable ? I don't have this ambition, but at least the first thing ... maybe yes

I'm not a professionist developer! I would like so much! I work as workman and the free time ? This could be see as hooby, one of the many I have!

SL it's written on Android (Java)! One day It will be a Webapp that rocks!

His Database is a Firebase storage. Now it's time to work! It's sunday so I exploit while I can! Best Wishes Guys
